<h2> Siu Nim Tao </h2>

The form shows the centreline theory it places great emphasis on correct posture and shows the wing chun hand shapes and techniques such as Bong Sau, Tan Sau and Fook sau. These are known has the three seeds of wing chun.

When you reach Chum Kiu level, you should of grasped the basics of Siu Nim Tao and now you are applying more movements by utilising your hips known as Yiu ma in order generate more force into applications. 

<h2> Biu Tze </h2>

<P> The third form in wing chun is translated as Darting fingers. Darting or Kiu refers to the type of energy used. This form is taking the different stages that you learned through your development from the first and second form where you have learnt how to apply energy and power through relaxation and movement. We now include even more weaponry such as the fingers and elbows. The third form takes an even more humble approach by accepting that nothing is perfect and because of this, you may need a back up plan to be effective.

<h2> The Wooden Dummy </h2>

With the wing chun dummy, you learn to move around their pressure in order to practice simultaneously attacking and defending. The arms on the legs and dummy represents obstacles or pathways of pressure from someone while the attack you. You learn to move around the dummy's arms and legs to get positions of leverage. 

<h2> Chi Sao </h2>

Chi Sao is Known as Sticking hands, it's a wing chun training exercise designed to develop close range combat skills. In close range combat, your ability to see an incoming strike a punch and react by reflex is greatly diminished. Which is where the skills developed through chi sau apply. 

<h2> Pak Sau Chi Sau </h2>

The purpose for pak sau chi sau is to train mid-range. Wing Chun is know for it's close quarters combat, However you need to get to that range first. The man Sao or asking hand, and Pak Sao hand come into play even more. The emphasis here is on the touch and go reflexes and applying forward energy.
